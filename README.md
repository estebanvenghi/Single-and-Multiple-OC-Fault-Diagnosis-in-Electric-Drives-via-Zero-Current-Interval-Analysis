This record contains the experimental results presented in the paper entitled 
“Single and Multiple Open-Switch Fault Diagnosis in Electric Drives via Zero-Current Interval Analysis,” 
published in the IEEE Latin America Transactions journal. As indicated by the title, 
this paper proposes a strategy for fault detection and isolation in inverter switches.
Therefore, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed diagnosis method under different operating conditions, 
both with and without inverter faults.

To reproduce the results, first run the MATLAB script named “leer_ensayo_X_f.m.” 
Then, execute the Excel file “generico_f.xls.” Finally, run the MATLAB script “graficar_ENSAYOX_f.m.”

For proper execution, make sure to set the working directory to the folder that contains these files, 
along with the documentation available in the “Datos” folder. 
Note that the “Datos” folder also includes the experimental datasets 
and the MATLAB script “param_MI_LV.m,” which defines the parameters of the motor used in the experiments.
